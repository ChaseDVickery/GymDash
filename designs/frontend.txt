Title:      Frontend Design Doc
Author:     Chase Vickery

Description:
    This document discusses the kinds of features desired on the frontend
    display for GymDash. Needs may change and grow as I experiment with the
    package, so this will not be a static document.

Desired Features:
    -Create and store configs for your project. Configs describe the simulations
    that should run on the backend.
    -Simulation Interaction:
        -Begin simulations (through custom or stored configs)
        -Abort simulations
        -Query simulations
            -progress
        -On-demand recording
            -Ex. ask a simulation to record a video of its current episode.
            -Ex. ask a simulation to return a specially evaluated value.
    -Display scalar plots.
    -Provide an easy-to-use API for querying for stats from the backend.
