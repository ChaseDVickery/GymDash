# Sidebar
The Simulation Sidebar on the left of the screen provides an overview of the
project's Simulations and provides some interactivity.\
![A tall sidebar showing a list of simulation names in boxes. Each box has a checkbox and a progress bar](../../imgs/sidebar.png).

Each running or completed simulation is shown on the sidebar in a selection box. Boxes display the simulation name, a progress/status indicator, and a selection checkbox. Select any number of simulations by right-clicking and dragging over a set of simulation boxes. Hovering over a simulation box will also show the current progress or status of that simulation. The displayed status is the latest status known for the simulation.
